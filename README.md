# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing coffee shop sales data to identify revenue trends, peak sales periods, and top-performing products. The analysis helps business owners and managers make informed decisions regarding operations, staffing, and inventory planning.

Each record represents sales activity used to evaluate performance patterns over time.

## Tools Used

## Methodology
